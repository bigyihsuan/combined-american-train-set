# Combined American Train Set

![KITTY CAT](./logo.png)

A North American-themed train set, written in NML.
You can think of it as a NARS successor, but the only real link is the roster and associated vehicle properties.

## 1.0 Goals

Total feature parity with NARS:

- All vehicles implemented
- B-units
- Semi-randomized boxcar appearances
- Semi-randomized cargo (when available)

## 1.1 Goals

Some more features to bring NARS to the modern day.

- More 2cc support. Engines in particular: most don't have 2cc.
- Randomized goods cars, like Iron Horse. For nice-looking random manifests.
- More parameters for tweaking costs.
