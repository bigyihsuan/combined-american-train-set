# Vehicle-specific special behavior

This file documents special behavior and interactions between certain locomotives and certain cars.

## B-units

The following locos have B-units:

- EMD FP9
- (more...)

B-units only appear in chains of identical locomotives (i.e. train of EMD FP9, EMD FT, and EMD FP9, the middle FT will be an A-unit). For the rest of this document, this will be called a ***chain***.

<!-- Locos with B-units have the following conditions:

- If it's the first unit of a chain:
  - and is forward,
    - **A unit**
  - and is reversed,
    - **B unit**
- If it's the non-first unit of a chain:
  - and there is an A-unit in front of it,
    - and there is no more locos in the chain behind it,
      - and is forward,
        - **B-unit**
      - and is reversed,
        - **A-unit**
    - and there are more locos in the chain behind it,
      -  -->
